# 20191129

1. A new release 0.5.1 was avaible.
	* The RPT value now is affected by the number of impeached blocks in latest 10,000 blocks.
	* To put it more specifically, for each impeached block, the corresponding proposer gets its original RPT value 1/9 reduced.
	* The minimum possible value of PRT is 1000. 
	* Exsiting test cases have been adjusted for this version. And more cases have been added into test cases repository.

2. A minor adjustment will also be available soon.
	* It is for the bug reported in https://github.com/CPChain/chain/issues/96
	* It bug is introduced since `cpchain` syncs the blocks in batch via multi threads. In other word, the blocks are not synced in order. However, the calculation of number of impeached blocks traverses the latest 10,000 blocks in order, which may raise an error if the synced blocks are not consecutive.
